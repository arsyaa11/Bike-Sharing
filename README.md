# Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics


This is the final project from the "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python" course by Dicoding, aimed at conducting analysis and creating a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the Proyek_Analisis_Data file, I've included the steps I took for Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I've created a dashboard using Streamlit, which you can access by clicking on the link provided in [here](https://proyekakhirpy-ncltze4p5wqyvlwes7hfb3.streamlit.app/).

For further information, like the background of this dataset you can check out the `Readme` file.

## 2. Project work cycle
1. Data Wrangling: 
 - Gathering data
 - Assessing data
 - Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
 - Defined business questions for data exploration
 - Create Data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
 - Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
4. Dashboard:
 - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
 - Make filter components on the dashboard
 - Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

**Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.**

## 3. Getting Started
### `notebook.ipynb`
1. Download this project.
2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (in here I will use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

### `dashboard/dashboard.py`
1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
   
You can see the results in the Screenshots folder
